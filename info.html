  <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Logistic regression is a regression model where the dependent variable is categorical. This
article covers the case of a binary dependent variablethat is, where the output can take only
two values, ”0” and ”1”, which represent outcomes such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or
healthy/sick. Cases where the dependent variable has more than two outcome categories
may be analysed in multinomial logistic regression, or, if the multiple categories are
ordered, in ordinal logistic regression. In the terminology of economics, logistic regression
is an example of a qualitative response/discrete choice model. The binary logistic model is
used to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor (or
independent) variables (features).The model itself simply models probability of output in
terms of input, and does not perform statistical classification (it is not a classifier), though it
can be used to make a classifier, for instance by choosing a cutoff value and classifying
inputs with probability greater than the cutoff as one class, below the cutoff as the other.</p>

<h3>Support Vector Machines</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>SVM stands for support vector machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm which
can be used for both classification or regression challenges.In this method, each data item is
plotted as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the
value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.The support vector machines
algorithm generates a mapping function from a set of labeled training data.The kernel
functions transform the input data into a high- dimensional feature space, an thus the input
data can be categorized even when data are not linearly separable.It is a mapping done to
the training data to improve its resemblance to a linearly separable set of data.</p>

<h3>Multi Layered Perceptron</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>MLP stands for Multi Layered Perceptron model is a class of feed forward networks.
Unlike a perceptron model MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes. Except for the
input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function like sigmoid.
An activation function is a linear function that maps the weighted inputs to the output of
each neuron. From the input of the input layer the output of the hidden layer is calculated.
This output of the hidden layer is fed as input to the output layer and the output of the
model is calculated. The generated output is compared with the actual output. If there are
any discrepancies backpropogation algorithm is used to rectify them. Backpropagation (BP)
is an error-minimizing algorithm which tunes weights to generate the desired mapping</p>

<h3>Random Forest</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classify
and regress and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at
training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean
prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision
trees’ habit of over fitting to their training set. Random forest gives much more accurate
predictions when compared to simple CART/CHAID or regression models in many
scenarios. These cases generally have high number of predictive variables and huge sample
size. This is because it captures the variance of several input variables at the same time and
enables high number of observations to participate in the prediction.</p>

<h3>Voting CLassifier</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Voting is one of the simplest ways of combining the predictions from multiple machine
learning algorithms. It works by first creating two or more standalone models from your
training dataset. A Voting Classifier can then be used to wrap your models and average the
predictions of the sub-models when asked to make predictions for new data. The
predictions of the sub-models can be weighted, but specifying the weights for classifiers
manually or even heuristically is difficult. More advanced methods can learn how to best
weight the predictions from submodels, but this is called stacking</p>
